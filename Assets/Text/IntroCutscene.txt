Z: Sola? What are you doing here? I’m supposed to be working!
S: I know but I-
Z: Wait, don’t tell me this is about the band again…We’ve talked about this!
S: Okay, but just hear me out this time! I think I’ve figured it out!
Z: What is there to figure out? The Rhythm Fighters is dead. We were all just too different… wanted different things… different music…
S: Yeah but, what if there were a way to make everyone happy?
Z: How? Like take us for example? I want to make heavy metal, and you want punk rock.
S: So let’s do both!
Z: Both?
S: Yeah, like both at the same time.
Z: How would we even do that?
S: Well, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have your guitar on you?
Z: Always.
