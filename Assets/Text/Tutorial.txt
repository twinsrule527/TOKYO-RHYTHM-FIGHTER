STAGE 1, 1-beat tap attack 

Sola: I’m early. Sforzanda will be here soon. I should warm up. 
Game: Press 'SPACE' to continue the tutorial.

Game: Tap (Z) on the beat to play a note.



STAGE 2, 2-beat hold attack 

Sola: Yep, I'm in tune. Now for some longer, badder notes.

Game: Hold (X) for 2 beats to hold a long note.
Game: You're freestyling. You choose when to either Tap (Z) or Hold (X). 



STAGE 3, combos 

Sola: If I can keep a groove going, that’ll really show her. 

Game: Hitting multiple notes in a row will build up a combo.
Game: Missing a note will end a combo.
Game: Try a 2-beat hold (X) immediately followed by a few taps (Z)! 



STAGE 4, harmonizing w/ boss 

Sola: I can hear Sforzanda warming up too. 
Sola: If I want to make this band work, I’ll have to improvise and harmonize with her notes on the fly. 

Game: Tap (C) instead of (Z) or (X) to harmonize with Sforzanda’s incoming notes when they hit the center.
Game: Playing your own notes with (Z) or (X) won't harmonize with hers.

Sola: I can’t miss anything she throws at me!

Game: Harmonizing keeps up a combo, but failing to do so ends one!



STAGE 5; end 

Sola: Here she comes. 
Sola: If I can blend my freestyle with harmonizing with her notes, I can show her we can make this band work!
